#### Abstract ####
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing is a multi carrier modulations technique, which is an efficient high speed data transmission. It is widely used in various wireless communication systems and standards due to its high data rate, hight spectral efficiency and robustness to multipath fading channel. World is running towards high data rate transmission for multimedia applications. In single carrier system, the symbol duration decreases with increase in data rate which leads to Inters Sysmbol Interference.

It is a multicarrier scheme utililzing the parallel data transmission by means of Frequency Division Multiplexing with overlapping subcarriers without interfering. It means dividing a frequency selective fading channel into small orthogonal flat fading channels. “Orthogonality” prevents the demodulators from seeing frequencies other than their own. And each subchannel has low bit rate and with large number of  subchannels gives high data rate. So ISI gets reduced due to large symbol duration. Doppler shift and mismatch between transmitter and receiver local oscillator frequencies gives frequency offset. This Carrier Frequency Offset reduces orthogonality between subcarriers which leads to the signal on one subcarrier to depend on another subcarrier which is known as Inter Carrier Interference. It is a challenge for error free demodulation and detection of OFDM symbols.

The major challenge in OFDM is PAPR along with ICI. Here, we are trying to implement the techniques for reducing PAPR as high PAPRs require highly linear amplifiers. The techniques reduce the PAPR at the cost of complexity. The techniques include Clipping, Companding in distortion based techniques and Selected Mapping(SLM), Partial Transmit Sequences(PTS), Tone Reservation, Coding schemes in non-distortion techniques.
