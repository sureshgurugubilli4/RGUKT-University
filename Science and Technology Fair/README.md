#### Synopsis ####
RedTacton is a new networking technology which is under development, also called Human Area Networking (HAN). It’s  a Japanese technology ,first proposed by NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) in 2005. It is totally different from other networks like LAN and WAN, uses weak electric field present on human body as the medium to transmit digital data over few centimetres. Data can be transferred just by placing your one hand on transmitter chip (redtacton Transceiver chip) and other on receiver. So far, half duplex communication is implemented using PC type and hub Type protocols at a rate of 10Mbps however this technology supports full duplex communication also.

#### Abstract ####

“RedTacton” gives the whole new meaning to the term “Networking”.
RedTacton is a new personal area networking technology which uses the surface of the human body as the safe and high speed communication network by name HAN(Human Area Networking). It uses a weak electric field on the surface of the human body for data transmission. It is completely distinct from wireless and infrared technologies .The speed of the data transmission is up to 10Mbps. The RedTacton chips, contains a transmitter and receiver to send and accept data in digital format. Communication is possible using any body surfaces, such as the hands, fingers, arms, feet, face, legs or torso. Red Tacton works through shoes and clothing as well. When the physical contact gets separated, the communication is ended . Touch and action gives Tacton, and word Red – a warm colour – to emphasize warm and cordial communications. This technology was developed by Japanese Company Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation.

To achieve this convenience, it is necessary to efficiently control the RedTacton module (an advanced, compact electric-field communication module providing bidirectional communication) with low power consumption.


##### How Red Tacton works? #####
Using a new super-sensitive photonic electric field sensor, Red Tacton can achieve duplex communication over the human body at a maximum speed of 10 mbps. The Red Tacton transmitter induces a weak electric field on the surface of the body. The Red Tacton receiver senses changes in the weak electric field on the surface of the body caused by the transmitter.

Red Tacton relies upon the principle that the optical properties of an electro-optic crystal can vary according to the changes of a weak electric field. Red Tacton detects changes in the optical properties of an electro-optic crystal using a laser and converts the result to an electrical signal in an optical receiver  circuit.

The transmitter sends data by inducing fluctuations in the minute electric field on the surface of the human body. Data is received using a photonic electric field sensor that combines  an electro-optic crystal and a laser light to detect fluctuations in the minute electric field.


##### RedTacton has three main functional features: #####
* Touch - Touching, gripping, sitting, walking, stepping and other human movements can be the triggers for unlocking or locking, starting or stopping equipment, or obtaining data.
* Broadband and Interactive - Duplex, interactive communication is possible at a maximum speed of 10Mbit/s. Because the transmission path is on the surface of the body, transmission speed does not deteriorate in congested areas where many people are communicating at the same time.
* Any media - In addition to the human body, various conductors and dielectrics can be used as transmission media. Conductors and dielectrics may also be used in combination.
